## Summary

I work as a *process engineer* in a state company. Our company is focused on the development of optoelectronic systems. I like this job, but I feel the need for *new knowledge*, for new opportunities.


I became a high-level specialist, but over time I ran into the ceiling. I just want to work in a new, growing field with fun, interesting people. With all due respect, but a state company is not such a good place. I want to receive information that helps me to do more useful work and allows me *to be useful to other people*.


I have great communication skills. I'm not afraid of great responsibility, I have the *ability to learn* and improve my skills. I always wanted to be a useful part of the *team and society*, I wanted to create something interesting, beautiful and valuable.


Now I think it's time *to change* something in *my life* and act! So, and I'm **start learning Frontend** at here!
